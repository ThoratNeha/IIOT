# IIOT
## Introduction
The industrial internet of things (IIoT) refers to the extension and use of the internet of things (IoT) in industrial sectors and applications. With a strong focus on machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, big data, and machine learning, the IIoT enables industries and enterprises to have better efficiency and reliability in their operations. The IIoT encompasses industrial applications, including robotics, medical devices, and software-defined production processes.
## **Setting up the development environment for IIOT**
### Installing Dependencies
you will need to install Node.js, react and MQTT
### 1. Node.js
#### step-1: Download the installer
Download the windows intaller from [NodeJs official website](https://nodejs.org/en/). Make sure you have downloaded the latest version of NodeJs. It includes the NPM package manager.<br>
Here, we are choosing the 64-bit version of the Node.js installer<br>

The LTS (Long-term Support) version is highly recommended for you. After the download of the installer package, install it with a double-click on it.<br>
Now .msi file will be downloaded to your browser. Choose the desired location for that.<br>

After choosing the path, double-click to install .msi binary files to initiate the installation process. Then give access to run the application.

- By clicking on the Next button, you will get a custom page setup on the screen. Make sure you choose npm package manager , not the default of Node.js runtime . This way, we can install Node and NPM simultaneously.
You should have 143MB of space to install Node.js and npm features.

The following features will be installed by default:
- Node.js runtime
- Npm package manager
- Online documentation shortcuts
- Add to Path
